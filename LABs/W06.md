# W06 - SoC (Separation of Concerns) - MVC MVP 

reduction of coupling and increasing cohesion.
- Cohesion is the measure of similarity by the set of duties, level of details, and locality.
- Coupling, on the other hand, is the measure of dependence of the part on the rest of the system (low dependence ~ loose coupling).

## Rule
- separate the logic of the application from the logic of the presentation logic, persistency, and the logic for communication with external systems
- define clear boundaries between different components or layers of a system.
