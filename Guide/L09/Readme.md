## Core values
- Business value is given more importance than technical strategy.  
- Strategic goals are given more importance than project-specific benefits.  
- Intrinsic interoperability is given more importance than custom integration.  
- Shared services are given more importance than specific-purpose implementations.  
- Flexibility is given more importance than optimization.  
- Evolutionary refinement is given more importance than pursuit of initial perfection.
