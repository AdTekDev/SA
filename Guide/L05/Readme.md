** The process of designing a parallel algorithm consists of four steps:  
□ decomposition of a computational problem into tasks that can be executed simultaneously, and development of sequential algorithms for individual tasks;  
□ analysis of computation granularity;  
□ minimizing the cost of the parallel algorithm;  
□ assigning tasks to processors executing the parallel algorithm.  

## Notes

1. Phân rã Tasks
2. Phân chia Tasks (mapping / distribute / reduce) tới các PC/Process/Threads
3. Thực thi tính toán cho từng Process/Threads
4. Thu hồi kết quả (gathering) từ các Process/Threads
5. Tổng hợp kết quả
